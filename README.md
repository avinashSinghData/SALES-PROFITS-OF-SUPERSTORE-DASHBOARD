Sales and profit Analysis of Superstore — Power BI, Excel

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**
Decision-makers at the US Superstore need a clear and structured way to understand overall performance, drill into detailed sales analysis, and anticipate future trends. However, insights related to key KPIs, category and regional performance, and forecasted sales are scattered across raw data, making it difficult to move from high-level overview to actionable insights. 
This dashboard addresses that gap by providing a multi-page, interactive solution with navigable views for summary performance, detailed sales analysis, and forecasting to support informed business decisions.

**DATA CHALLENGES**
**1. Data Quality and Consistency**
The dataset contains variations in categorical fields such as region, state, and product categories that required standardization for accurate aggregation.
Missing or inconsistent values in certain fields needed validation before analysis.

**2. Granularity Across Multiple Dimensions**
Sales and profit needed to be analyzed across different levels (overall, regional, category, and time).
Designing visuals that allow meaningful insights without overwhelming users was a key challenge.

**3. Time-Based Analysis and Forecasting**
Sales data spans multiple time periods, requiring proper date hierarchies for trend and forecast analysis.
Ensuring that historical trends were correctly represented before generating forecasts was critical.

**4. Performance and Model Optimization**
Multiple KPIs and visuals across pages required careful data modeling to maintain responsiveness.
Measures were optimized to support smooth navigation between pages.

**5. Insight Alignment Across Pages**
Maintaining consistency between summary KPIs and detailed analysis views was essential to avoid conflicting interpretations.
Filters and interactions had to be aligned so insights remained coherent across pages.
